        <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>Fried chicken wings are delicious, but they make a big mess. These air fryer wings are super easy, and they're just as crunchy as the deep-fried kind.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
                <li>1/4 c. hot sauce (such as Frank's)</li>
                <li>4 tbsp. melted butter</li>
                <li>1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
                <li>Blue cheese dressing, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>Directions</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Season wings all over with salt and pepper, and coat the inside of air fryer with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Set air fryer to 380° and cook wings 12 minutes. Remove air fryer tray, flip wings, and cook 12 minutes more. Increase heat to 400° and cook 5 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk to combine hot sauce, butter, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder. Add cooked wings and toss gently to coat. Serve hot with blue cheese dressing for dipping.</li>
